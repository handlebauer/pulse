# Radio Transcription Visualization - Future Enhancements

## Phase 2 Ideas

### Advanced Topic Analysis

- Implement proper NLP for topic extraction (e.g., using TF-IDF or LDA)
- Use a more sophisticated entity recognition system to identify people, places, organizations
- Implement sentiment analysis to color-code topics based on positive/negative sentiment

### Enhanced Visualization

- Create "topic bridges" between stations discussing similar topics
- Implement a heat map overlay showing topic intensity across regions
- Add time-based visualization to show how topics spread geographically over time
- Create a "word cloud" view that aggregates topics across all stations

### User Interaction

- Add topic filtering to highlight stations discussing specific topics
- Implement search functionality to find stations by topic
- Create a "topic explorer" sidebar to browse and filter by popular topics
- Allow users to save favorite topics for monitoring

### Technical Improvements

- Optimize Supabase realtime subscriptions for better performance
- Implement caching for transcription data
- Add pagination for historical transcription data
- Improve error handling and fallbacks

### Data Analysis

- Track topic trends over time
- Identify geographic patterns in topic distribution
- Compare topic coverage between different types of stations
- Measure topic diversity across stations

### UI/UX Refinements

- Improve topic bubble design and positioning
- Add animations for topic transitions
- Create a more detailed transcription view with speaker identification
- Implement responsive design for mobile devices
